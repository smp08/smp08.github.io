<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Stefano. I moved from the Dominican Republic to Miami when I was 15 years old and have lived here ever since. I have to admit, it was a bit of a culture shock but I got used to it pretty quick. Advertising is my passion and I have had the opportunity to work in the industry for 2 years now. Feel free to browse through my site to view some of the work I've done. Cheers!</p>
